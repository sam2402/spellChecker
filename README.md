# Spell Checker

## About Spell Checker
This takes text via a file or keyboard input and returns the misspelt words

## Notes on Use

 - I couldn't find a fully complete dictionary. The provided words file didn't contain verb conjugations (eg. walked or sings). The dictionary I'm using contains those conjugations but doesn't have other words like months or days. It also has some very uncommon words that a person may assume are misspelt words.
 - If you want to change the dictionary used, there are three dictionaries in the Dictionaries directory. Put the one you want use in the root directory and rename it "dictionary.txt".
 - To spell check a file, put the file in the root directory.

### To Run Spell Checker
